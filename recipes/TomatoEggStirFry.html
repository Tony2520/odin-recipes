  <!--Description -->
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Stir-fried tomatoes and eggs. If you’ve had it, you know why you’d want to make it again and again. If you haven’t had it, it may not sound like much.
    But for many Chinese people, this dish represents home-cooked comfort food, or <strong>家常菜 </strong> <em>(jia chang cai)</em>. Every family has their own version.
    When I was studying abroad in China, many American students there with me LOVED this stir fried tomato and egg dish, and we ordered it every time we went to a little local place where dinner cost about 7 RMB (a little over a dollar).
    Of course, those American students were chowing down their tomato egg stir-fry right next to the Chinese students, who also appreciated an affordable, tasty dinner.
    Tomato and egg are a beloved combination in general––also check out our tomato egg noodle soup and our tomato egg drop soup!</p>

  <!--Ingredients-->
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 Eggs</li>
    <li>1-2 Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Green Onions</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Salt</li>

  <!--Steps-->
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start by cutting tomatoes into small wedges</li>
    <li>Be sure to remove the stems.</li>
    <li>Finely chop the scallion. Then crack 4 eggs into a bowl and season with ¼ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon white pepper, ½ teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Beat eggs for a minute.</li>
    <li>Preheat the wok over medium heat until it just starts to smoke. Then add 2 tablespoons of oil and immediately add the eggs. Scramble the eggs and remove from the wok immediately. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Add 1 more tablespoon oil to the wok, turn up the heat to high, and add the tomatoes and scallions.</li>
    <li>Stir-fry for 1 minute, and then add 2 teaspoons sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste), and ¼ cup water (if your stove gets very hot and liquid tends to cook off very quickly in your wok, add a little more water). Add the cooked eggs.</li>
    <li>Mix everything together, cover the wok, and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the tomatoes are completely softened.
      Uncover, and continue to stir-fry over high heat until the sauce thickens to your liking. Serve with steamed rice.</li>
    <li>Feel free to add more scallions, more or less seasonings, etc. Adjust this recipe to make it how you like it!</li>
